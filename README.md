# Snake Game
**by Thomas Neal**

----
**Project Description**

In this project, I was provided the code base and necessary resource files for the game "Snake" written in Java. Initially, I was tasked to set up a git repository in order to implement version control into my project. Following this, basic maintenance of the delivered code base was required such as reorganisation, adding encapsulation, and splitting files into packages. On top of basic maintenance, additions to the game were required such as implementing a main menu, highscore screen, additional levels etc.

**How to install and run the project**

1. Install a Java IDE of your choice (preferably IntelliJ)
2. Download the src code files and the resources and load them into your IDE to make a Java project
3. OR fork the GitLab project and clone the project on your computer/IDE
4. Run the file "Menu.MC.Main.java", this should run the game and make it playable

**How to play the game**
Snake is a game that involves navigating around the provided map eating food, which increases your length alongside your score
- On the main menu, input your name, choose your options, then start the game.
- In order to navigate around the levels, use the arrow keys on your keyboard
- Navigate yourself towards the food, when you eat it your snake grows and your points will increase
- Be careful not to move your snake into the border of the map or your snake will die and your game will end.
- In order to use the custom background feature, place your chosen photo in the project's /resources/assets/ folder then type the name of the file in on the main menu to load it into the game.
